# Robot Maze Solver ðŸ¤–

A web-based maze solver that uses the left-hand wall following algorithm to navigate through randomly generated mazes.

## Features

- **Three Maze Generation Algorithms:**
  - Randomized Prim's Algorithm (default)
  - Recursive Backtracking
  - Kruskal's Algorithm

- **Intelligent Robot Pathfinding:**
  - Left-hand wall following algorithm
  - Automatic dead-end detection
  - Real-time visual feedback

- **Interactive Controls:**
  - Adjustable maze size (5x5 to 100x100)
  - Variable robot speed (1-100)
  - Pause/Resume functionality
  - Reset and regenerate options
  - Credits button showing project information

- **Visual Feedback:**
  - Green cells: Explored paths
  - Red cells: Dead ends
  - Animated robot movement
  - Victory screen on completion

## Getting Started

### Running Locally

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Or use a local server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   # Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
cd tests
node run-all-tests.js
```

## How It Works

### Maze Generation

The application generates perfect mazes (mazes with exactly one path between any two points) using one of three algorithms:

1. **Randomized Prim's Algorithm**: Builds the maze by randomly selecting walls to remove, creating organic-looking mazes
2. **Recursive Backtracking**: Creates mazes with long, winding corridors
3. **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Uses union-find to create mazes with shorter paths

### Robot Navigation

The robot uses the **left-hand wall following** algorithm:

1. **Priority order**: Left â†’ Forward â†’ Right â†’ Back
2. At each step, the robot tries to turn left first
3. If left is blocked, it tries forward
4. If forward is blocked, it tries right
5. If all three are blocked, it backtracks (dead end)

This algorithm guarantees finding the exit in any perfect maze.

## Controls

- **Maze Size**: Set grid size (5-100)
- **Algorithm**: Choose maze generation algorithm
- **Speed**: Adjust robot speed (1=slowest, 100=fastest)
- **Start**: Begin robot navigation
- **Pause/Resume**: Pause and resume execution
- **Reset**: Return robot to start (keeps current maze)
- **Credits**: Display project information and development process
- **Next Maze**: Generate a new maze (appears after completion)

## Statistics

The game tracks:
- **Steps**: Total moves made by the robot
- **Dead Ends**: Number of dead ends encountered
- **Backtracks**: Number of times the robot had to backtrack
- **Time**: Elapsed time since start

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas
- **Animation**: requestAnimationFrame (60fps target)
- **Dependencies**: None (pure vanilla implementation)
